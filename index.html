Any API methods currently implemented are open to change at any time.</h3>

<p>This program is intended to make real-time collaboration easy. This is done with Operation Transformation, a technique through which operations are "transformed" according to the ones before them. This means that if we have two operations <code>delete(2,3)</code> and <code>insert(3,'a')</code> they will be transformed according to what is run before them. In this case when <code>insert</code> is run first, <code>delete</code> is unchanged, but if <code>delete</code> is run first, then <code>insert</code> must be changed so that it inserts one earlier.</p>

<p>Otter is being built in C so that it runs, as the professionals put it, "super-duper" fast. This will allow the wrappers to simply make a call to the optimized C, and everything can run nice and fast. </p>

<p>The plan is to use Redis to power the memory portion of this. The reason for this is because Redis is robust, fast, and most importantly, fault tolerant. </p>

<a id="api" class="anchor" href="#api" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>API</h2>

<p>Currently the api is still being planned, but I have a pretty good idea of what I want it to look like. I am thinking that it should look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>int create_document(string document_contents)</li>
<li>void insert(int document_id, int insertion_point, string insertion_contents, int parent_id, int client_id)</li>
<li>void delete(int document_id, int start_of_range, int end_of_range, int parent_id, int client_id)</li>
<li>string get_document_string(int document_id)</li>
<li>string get_operations_buffer(int document_id, int start_id)</li>
<li>void update_document(string updated_document_contents)</li>
<li>string close_document(int document_id)</li>
</ul>

<p>As of right now, it will be the developer's responsibility to pull the operations buffer for each client, but that will likely be added functionality in later versions.</p>

<p>Right now this is a personal project, and I want to bring this to version 1 by myself, but if you are interested in building a language wrapper, or the Javascript client, for Otter, start an issue on this repository and we can start to discuss how this should be done.</p>
